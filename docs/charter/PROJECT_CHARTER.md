# hc-grc Research Platform — Project Charter

**Version**: 0.1 (Planning)  
**Date**: 2026-06-09  
**Status**: Architecture Design Phase  

---

## 1. Purpose and Positioning

The hc-grc program is a modular, scientifically rigorous research platform for the empirical characterization of cybersecurity and data privacy control space. It is designed to grow beyond any single research question into a durable analytical infrastructure — the equivalent of a software product, not a one-off analysis.

The primary corpus is the Secure Controls Framework (SCF), used as both a research subject and an alignment substrate. The SCF's 1,400+ controls, 200+ STRM-mapped Laws/Regulations/Frameworks (LRFs), 39 risk categories, 6-level maturity model, and risk/threat crosswalks constitute a uniquely rich, openly licensed, machine-readable dataset for control space analysis.

**The core tension the platform exploits**: The SCF claims Expert-Derived Content (EDC) produces superior crosswalk mappings versus NLP/ML approaches. No empirical validation of those 280,000+ mappings has ever been published. Every analytical module in this platform addresses some dimension of that gap — directly or indirectly.

**Strategic output**: Published research, practitioner-facing tools, and commercially deployable analytical products that serve the three audiences defined in the project's user personas.

## 1.5 Strategic Program Context

**This project is Tier 1 of a three-tier research program.** Every design decision — data schemas, ARA artifact formats, graph data models, null result handling — is made with Tier 2 and Tier 3 as downstream consumers.

### The Three Tiers

**Tier 1 — Framework Science (this project, plus future framework projects)**

The SCF is simultaneously the research subject and the measurement instrument. Its ~280,000 STRM mappings are structured, testable claims: "SCF control X has relationship type R to framework Y control Z." The platform does not accept those claims — it tests them. Per-framework knowledge graphs are the primary output. Null results — mappings that fail empirical testing — are first-class findings, not failures.

Future Tier 1 projects: `hc-grc-nist-800-53`, `hc-grc-nist-800-82`, `hc-grc-cis-v8`. Each follows identical methodology (P1–P5 modules, same LangGraph architecture, same gate structure). Each is an independent project to preserve pre-registration integrity — no framework project's confirmatory data contaminates another's hypothesis formation.

**Tier 2 — Comparative Analysis (future: `hc-grc-comparative`)**

Ingests all Tier 1 knowledge graphs. Answers cross-framework questions: where does the GRC landscape genuinely converge? Which controls are empirically load-bearing across multiple independent frameworks? What is the blast radius — if control X fails, what cascades through the cross-framework topology? What are the underlying control archetypes the industry has reproduced under dozens of different names?

This tier requires two or more Tier 1 projects completed before it starts.

**Tier 3 — Organizational Impact Modeling (deferred: `hc-grc-impact`)**

The commercially significant tier. Takes Tier 2's empirical findings and models them against real organizations to quantify: which control failures drive financial losses, and by how much? Not correlation — causal inference (causal forests, do-calculus) so the answer is actionable. SHAP values provide the explainability layer. Monte Carlo simulation produces probability distributions over financial outcomes with confidence intervals.

Tier 3 is deferred. It requires Tier 2 outputs and external data (breach databases, financial loss records) with privacy and consent constraints outside the current scope. It is documented here because Tier 1 design decisions must not foreclose Tier 3 feasibility.

### Design Requirements Flowing from This Context

1. **ARA artifact schema must be framework-agnostic.** The knowledge graph export must work identically for NIST 800-53, CIS v8, and SCF. No SCF-specific assumptions in the schema.
2. **Null results are structured identically to positive findings.** Tier 2 and Tier 3 consume the full result distribution; suppressed or unstructured null results break the pipeline.
3. **Confidence scores on all findings.** Tier 3 uses these as ML model features. If findings don't carry confidence scores, the Tier 3 feature space is impoverished.
4. **P2 topology graphs must be designed for multi-graph composition.** The blast radius model in Tier 2 runs graph diffusion across the combined cross-framework topology. P2's data model must support it.

See ADR-0010 for the full strategic program decision record.

## 2. Scope

All five analytical modules (P1–P5) are in scope. They are not sequential — they are parallel research tracks that share infrastructure, data models, and findings. Module outputs feed each other.

| Module | Name | Primary Question |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| P1 | STRM Calibration | Do the SCF's expert STRM mappings hold up under NLP-based semantic analysis? |
| P2 | Control Space Topology | Do the 33 editorial domains correspond to natural semantic clusters? |
| P3 | Regulatory Convergence | Which control domains have multi-jurisdictional consensus, and which are outliers? |
| P4 | Risk Blindspot Engine | Which of the 39 risk categories are systematically underserved by standard framework portfolios? |
| P5 | AI Governance Cluster Analysis | Which controls across all 33 domains are semantically entangled with AI governance — not just AAT? |

P5 is explicitly **not** an AAT domain filter. It is a cross-domain clustering problem: let the ML identify which controls across the entire SCF are semantically relevant to AI governance when the data, not the editorial taxonomy, makes that determination.

---

## 3. Architecture Design

The platform is modular at every layer. Adding a new framework, a new embedding model, a new analytical method, or a new research question requires adding a module — not refactoring existing ones.

## 5. Module Research Designs

### P1 — STRM Calibration: Auditing the Auditors

**Research question**: Do the SCF's expert-derived STRM mappings (relationship type and strength score) correspond to empirically measurable semantic relationships between control text and LRF requirement text?

**Why it matters**: The SCF's commercial and IP positioning rests on the claim that EDC produces superior mappings. This is the first empirical test of that claim at scale.

#### Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis | Null | Test |
|----|-----------|------|------|
| H1.1 | STRM strength scores (1–10) are positively correlated with embedding cosine similarity | ρ = 0 | Spearman rank correlation + permutation test |
| H1.2 | STRM relationship type is predictable from embedding similarity distributions | Accuracy = random baseline | Multi-class classification (logistic regression, SVM, fine-tuned BERT) |
| H1.3 | "Equal To" (=) mappings cluster at higher cosine similarity than "Intersects" (∩) | No distributional difference across types | Kruskal-Wallis H-test |
| H1.4 | STRM strength score calibration varies systematically by SCF domain | Calibration is uniform across domains | ANOVA / Kruskal-Wallis by domain group |
| H1.5 | NIST-cluster frameworks (800-53, CSF, 800-171) show higher NLP-STRM agreement than cross-cluster pairs | No difference | Mann-Whitney U test |
| H1.6 | High-strength STRM mappings (score ≥ 8) exhibit significantly higher NLP similarity than low-strength mappings (score ≤ 3) | No difference | Mann-Whitney U test |

### P2 — Control Space Topology

**Research question**: Do the SCF's 33 editorial domains correspond to natural semantic communities in the control graph, or are they organizational artifacts that obscure the actual structure of control space?

#### Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis | Null | Test |
|----|-----------|------|------|
| H2.1 | Community detection on the STRM-weighted control graph produces communities that differ significantly from the 33 editorial domains | Editorial partition = optimal community partition | Compare modularity Q of editorial partition vs. discovered partition (NMI, ARI) |
| H2.2 | Some SCF domains are structurally isolated (low cross-domain connectivity) while others are structurally central (high cross-domain connectivity) | Degree centrality is uniform across domain nodes | Degree centrality distribution test; identify hubs and isolates |
| H2.3 | The 39 risk categories form natural clusters in the control graph that cut across editorial domain lines | Risk categories cluster within, not across, domains | Community detection seeded by risk category labels; modularity comparison |
| H2.4 | STRM relationship type (⊂, ∩, =, ⊃) predicts edge weight in the control graph independently of strength score | Relationship type adds no information beyond strength score | Partial correlation; regression with both predictors |
| H2.5 | Graph density varies systematically across the 33 domains | Density is uniform | Chi-square on degree distribution by domain |

**Algorithm Inventory**
- Graph construction: NetworkX, PyG, iGraph

### P3 — Regulatory Convergence Atlas

**Research question**: Which SCF control domains have multi-jurisdictional regulatory consensus, and which are dominated by single-jurisdiction mandates?

#### Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis | Null | Test |
|----|-----------|------|------|
| H3.1 | LRFs cluster into groups that share control domain emphasis patterns, independent of geographic region | Clustering by control domain profile matches geographic clustering | Compare cluster assignments: domain-profile-based vs. geography-based (ARI) |
| H3.2 | A small subset of SCF domains (< 20%) accounts for > 60% of all STRM mappings | STRM mappings are uniformly distributed across domains | Pareto analysis; chi-square goodness-of-fit test |
| H3.3 | STRM relationship type distribution (⊂ vs. ∩ vs. = vs. ⊃) varies significantly by LRF category (law vs. regulation vs. framework) | Distribution is uniform across categories | Chi-square test on contingency table |
| H3.4 | Regulatory convergence (number of independent LRFs mapping to a domain) predicts SCF control density in that domain | No correlation | Spearman correlation: mapping count vs. control count by domain |

**Algorithm Inventory**

---

### P4 — Risk Blindspot Engine

**Research question**: Given a specific portfolio of compliance frameworks, which of the 39 SCF risk categories remain systematically underserved — and what is the materiality exposure implied by those gaps?

#### Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis | Null | Test |
|----|-----------|------|------|
| H4.1 | Framework portfolio coverage of the 39 risk categories is non-uniform — some risks are well-covered by nearly all portfolios, others are chronically underserved | Coverage is uniform across 39 risk categories | Chi-square test on coverage distribution |
| H4.2 | Common practitioner-facing framework combinations (e.g., NIST CSF + SOC 2; HIPAA + NIST 800-171) leave at least one risk group (R-SC or R-GV) with < 40% coverage | Coverage ≥ 40% across all groups for standard portfolios | Coverage scoring per portfolio; threshold analysis |
| H4.3 | MCR controls provide better risk coverage than DSR controls within the same domain | No difference | Mann-Whitney U on risk coverage scores: MCR vs. DSR by domain |
| H4.4 | Risk coverage gaps predicted by framework portfolio composition can be identified by a classifier with > 75% accuracy | Accuracy = baseline (majority class) | Multi-label classification: portfolio features → gap labels |

**Algorithm Inventory**
- Coverage matrix construction: binary (control present/absent) and weighted (STRM strength × relationship type)
- Set cover analysis: greedy approximation of minimum LRF set for maximum risk coverage
- Integer Linear Programming for exact minimum set cover (small instances)
- Multi-label classification (portfolio → gap prediction): Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, Classifier Chains
- Materiality scoring: tie risk exposure scores to SCF financial materiality thresholds (≥5% pre-tax income proxy)
- Pareto frontier analysis: coverage gain per additional framework
- Shapley values for framework contribution attribution

### P5 — AI Governance Cluster Analysis

**Research question**: Which controls across all 33 SCF domains are semantically entangled with AI governance — as determined by NLP clustering, not editorial domain assignment?

This module explicitly rejects the AAT domain filter as its starting point. The hypothesis is that AI governance implicates controls across many domains (IAC, DCH, TPM, GOV, RSK, MON, etc.) and that the AAT editorial boundary understates the true cross-domain footprint of AI governance requirements.

#### Hypotheses

| ID | Hypothesis | Null | Test |
|----|-----------|------|------|
| H5.1 | A significant portion (> 25%) of AI governance-relevant SCF controls fall outside the AAT domain when identified via NLP clustering rather than editorial assignment | AI governance controls are confined to AAT | Cross-domain percentage of AI governance cluster; chi-square vs. expected AAT concentration |
| H5.2 | AI governance LRFs (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF) map to SCF controls in a cross-domain pattern that the AAT domain alone cannot satisfy | AI governance LRF mappings are satisfied by AAT controls alone | Coverage analysis: AI LRFs vs. AAT-only controls vs. full AI governance cluster |
| H5.3 | AI governance controls form identifiable sub-clusters by risk type (data integrity, model governance, transparency, accountability) that cut across the 33 editorial domains | AI governance controls form one undifferentiated cluster | Sub-cluster analysis; label by AI risk taxonomy |
| H5.4 | The cross-domain AI governance cluster can be identified with > 80% precision from embedding space alone (without using domain labels as features) | Domain-label-free classification does not achieve > 80% precision | Binary classification: AI governance relevance predicted from embeddings |

**Algorithm Inventory**
- Embedding all 1,400+ controls (same models as P1)
- Embedding AI governance LRF requirement texts (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, SCF DPMP, ISO/IEC 42001 if available)
- Semantic similarity scoring: control ↔ AI governance requirement space
- Thresholding + binary classification to label "AI governance relevant" controls across all 33 domains
- K-means, HDBSCAN, BERTopic clustering on the labeled set
- Sub-cluster labeling via NLI-based topic assignment
- Cross-domain visualization: UMAP with domain color, AI governance overlay
- Comparison: SCF AAT domain controls vs. NLP-identified AI governance cluster (NMI, ARI, set overlap)
- AI governance coverage gap: which AI LRF requirements are unaddressed by AAT alone but satisfied by the full cluster?

## 7. Cross-Cutting Requirements

### Reproducibility
- All random seeds fixed and documented per experiment
- Data versioning: source files archived with SHA256 hash + download date
- Embedding cache: stored with model name + version in filename
- MLflow: every experiment logged with parameters, metrics, artifacts

### Scientific Rigor
- Every module's hypotheses pre-registered before analysis begins (documented in research/ directory)
- Multiple comparisons corrected (Bonferroni and/or Benjamini-Hochberg)
- Effect sizes reported alongside p-values
- Null results documented and published — a "no significant difference" finding is a finding
- Confidence intervals on all point estimates (bootstrap where parametric assumptions don't hold)

### Modularity Contract
- Every `src/` module is independently importable with no circular dependencies
- Every module accepts typed inputs from the canonical schema and returns typed outputs
- Analysis modules may depend on `src/` library modules but not on each other's outputs directly — outputs are written to `data/03-processed/` or `experiments/` and consumed by downstream modules via explicit file reads

### Extensibility Gates
- Adding a new framework: add a parser in `src/ingestion/`, add a `Framework` record, add a data acquisition note in this charter, ingest to `data/01-raw/`
- Adding a new embedding model: add to the embedding engine registry in `src/embeddings/`; all downstream modules consume from the embedding cache, so no changes elsewhere
- Adding a new P-module: add a research design file in `research/`, add an experiment directory, add `src/` components as needed

## 8. Licensing and IP Notes

All analysis is performed on openly licensed source material. The SCF's Creative Commons BY-ND 4.0 license permits analysis and derivative works with attribution. NIST materials are US government public domain. CIS Controls are available under CIS open terms for non-commercial analysis.

**Critical IP boundary**: The STRM calibration findings in P1 are themselves original analytical work — the comparison between NLP-derived similarity scores and SCF expert scores is not a derivative of the SCF. The methodology and findings are independently copyrightable research outputs.

The SCF's explicit argument that EDC > NLP for IP reasons does not preclude analyzing those mappings empirically. Observation ≠ reproduction.

---

## 9. Open Questions (To Be Resolved Before Build Begins)

1. **Historical version analysis**: SCF releases quarterly. How many historical versions should the initial corpus include? Version-comparison analysis (how the control graph evolves over time) is a potential P6 module.
2. **Paywalled frameworks**: ISO 27001, PCI DSS full text, HITRUST — at what point do we pursue licensing? These would significantly expand the LRF corpus in P3 and P4.
3. **Deliverable format**: Is the primary output (a) published research, (b) a practitioner-facing tool, (c) a commercial analytical product, or (d) all three in sequence? This affects how the reporting layer is built.
4. **Compute environment**: Embedding 1,400+ controls × 200+ LRF requirement sets at scale will require GPU time. Local (M-series Mac) may suffice for prototyping; cloud (Lambda Labs, Vast.ai) for production runs.
5. **STRM PDFs vs. Excel**: The SCF sells STRM Excel bundles ($25) — the free download includes STRM in the main Excel. Clarify whether the main download has all STRM data or only a subset, before designing the ingestion pipeline.
